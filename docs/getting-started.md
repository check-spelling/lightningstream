# Getting started

This section explains how to get started with PowerDNS Authoritative version 4.8+ and Lightning Stream.


!!! warning

    This page assumes the use of PowerDNS Authoritative version 4.8 and higher, which uses [native Lightning Stream value headers](schema.md).

    TODO: explain how to use with 4.7. Can it work with 4.6?


TODO:

- Docker demo (no schemaversion handling!)
